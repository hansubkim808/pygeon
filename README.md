# pygeon - Automation Toolkit for Rappers, Producers, and Sound Engineers 

The most difficult thing to stick to when growing your bootstrapped music brand, rap career, or production career is **consistency.** 


From Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and SoundCloud promotion, to marketing, visibility, branding, and using social media algorithms to your advantage to maximize exposure, there are a million different things that make up the formula for steady growth. 


**Pygeon helps you navigate your path to stardom by doing everything you don't want to.** 
With a Python toolkit at your disposal, Pygeon creates a seamless automated workflow for your music promotion process, from automatically sending beats and mastered tracks to appropriate mailing lists, to deploying AI-powered social media bots that spread your links and posts to the right people while you snooze. 

This is a work in progress, and this repo will be updated on a consistent basis. Stay tuned!
